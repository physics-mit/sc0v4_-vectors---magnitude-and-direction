  "description": "Start of transcript. Skip to the end.\nWe now look at representing vectors by their magnitude\nand direction.\nIn this example, we have a force here.\nWe can represent this force by its magnitude, which\nis the length of the vector, and the angle from the x-axis\ngoing towards the y-axis.\nWe can also separately represent the velocity\nas a vector with its own magnitude and direction.\nNotice that in this example the velocity\nis in a different direction than the force.\nEnd of transcript.
